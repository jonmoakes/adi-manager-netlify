# ADI Manager

ADI Manager is a business management application built specifically for UK driving instructors. It was designed to eliminate paperwork and streamline daily admin tasks, including lesson scheduling, pupil tracking, and financial management.

> 🛠 **Note**: This was my first commercial project and was developed early in my journey as a self-taught developer. While the code may not reflect my current standards, it has been successfully used by over 100 instructors and laid the foundation for my continued growth as a software engineer.

- 📅 **Diary Management** – Schedule and manage driving lessons with ease.
- 👨‍🎓 **Pupil Profiles** – Store lesson history, contact details, and learning progress.
- 📊 **Progress Tracking** – Log and review progress for each student.
- 💷 **Finance Dashboard** – Record income and expenses for at-a-glance insights.
- 🔐 **Secure Access** – Password-protected access for instructors.

## 📈 Project Impact

    <h2>5: Fair and lawful processing:</h2>
    <p>
      5.1: The Act is intended not to prevent the processing of personal data,
      but to ensure that it is done fairly and without adversely affecting the
      rights of the data subject. The data subject must be told who the data
      controller is (in this case Jonathan Oakes ), who the data 3 controller's
      representative is (in this case Jonathan Oakes ), the purpose for which
      the data is to be processed by us, and the identities of anyone to whom
      the data may be disclosed or transferred.
    </p>
    <p>
      5.2: For personal data to be processed lawfully, certain conditions have
      to be met. These may include, among other things, requirements that the
      data subject has consented to the processing, or that the processing is
      necessary for the legitimate interest of the data controller or the party
      to whom the data is disclosed. When sensitive personal data is being
      processed, more than one condition must be met. In most cases the data
      subject's explicit consent to the processing of such data will be
      required.
    </p>
    <p>
      5.3: Processing for limited purposes Personal data may only be processed
      for the specific purposes notified to the data subject when the data was
      first collected or for any other purposes specifically permitted by the
      Act. This means that personal data must not be collected for one purpose
      and then used for another. If it becomes necessary to change the purpose
      for which the data is processed, the data subject must be informed of the
      new purpose before any processing occurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      5.4: Adequate, relevant and non-excessive processing Personal data should
      only be collected to the extent that it is required for the specific
      purpose notified to the data subject. Any data which is not necessary for
      that purpose should not be collected in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
      5.5: Accurate data - Personal data must be accurate and kept up to date.
      Information which is incorrect or misleading is not accurate and steps
      should therefore be taken to check the accuracy of any personal data at
      the point of collection and at regular intervals afterwards. Inaccurate or
      out-of-date data should be destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      5.6: Timely processing Personal data should not be kept longer than is
      necessary for the purpose. This means that data should be destroyed or
      erased from our systems when it is no longer required.
    </p>
    <p>
      5.7: Processing in line with data subject's rights Data must be processed
      in line with data subjects' rights. Data subjects have a right to: (a)
      Request access to any data held about them by a data controller. (b)
      Prevent the processing of their data for direct-marketing purposes. (c)
      Ask to have inaccurate data amended. (d) Prevent processing that is likely
      to cause damage or distress to themselves or anyone else.

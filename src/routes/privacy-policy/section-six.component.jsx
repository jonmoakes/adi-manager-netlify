    <h2>6: Data security:</h2>
    <p>
      6.1: We must ensure that appropriate security measures are taken against
      unlawful or unauthorised processing of personal data, and against the
      accidental loss of, or damage to, personal data. Data subjects may apply
      to the courts for compensation if they have suffered damage from such a
      loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      6.2: The Act requires us to put in place procedures and technologies to
      maintain the security of all personal data from the point of collection to
      the point of destruction. Personal data may only be transferred to a
      third-party data processor if he agrees to comply with those procedures
      and policies, or if he puts in place adequate measures himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      6.3: Maintaining data security means guaranteeing the
      confidentiality,integrity and availability of the personal data, defined
      as follows: (a) Confidentiality means that only people who are authorised
      to use the data can access it. (b) Integrity means that personal data
      should be accurate and suitable for the purpose for which it is processed.
      (c) Availability means that authorised users should be able to access the
      data if they need it for authorised purposes. Personal data should
      therefore be stored on our central computer system instead of individual
      PCs.
    </p>
    <p>
      6.4: Security procedures include: (a) Entry controls. Any stranger seen in
      entry-controlled areas should be reported. (b) Secure lockable desks and
      cupboards. Desks and cupboards should be kept locked if they hold
      confidential information of any kind. (Personal information is always
      considered confidential.) (c) Methods of disposal. Paper documents should
      be shredded. (d) Equipment. Data users should ensure that individual
      monitors do not show confidential information to passers-by and that they
      log off from their PC when it is left unattended.
    </p>
    <p>
      6.5: Dealing with subject access requests. A formal request from a data
      subject for information that we hold about them must be made in writing. A
      fee is payable by the data subject for provision of this information.
    </p>
    <p>
      6.6: Providing information over the telephone. Dealing with telephone
      enquiries should be careful about disclosing any personal information held
      by us. In particular they should: 5 (a) Check the caller's identity to
      make sure that information is only given to a person who is entitled to
      it. (b) Suggest that the caller put their request in writing if they are
      not sure about the caller's identity and where their identity cannot be
      checked. No-one should be bullied into disclosing personal information.

      <p>there is no right or wrong way to use the app.</p>
      <p>
        you can store whatever data you need. so if you don't want to store your
        expenses details for instance, simply don't use that section! :)
      </p>
      <p>
        some people like to write out their diary in the diary section and then
        also make a detailed note of each lesson in the lessons section.
      </p>
      <p>
        some people prefer to ignore the diary section altogether and simply
        enter each lesson in the lessons tab. as the entries are automatically
        added in date order, in a way, it is a diary in itself!
      </p>
      <p>
        it is totally up to you which sections you use. only a select few fields
        are required on each input ( name and date for example ). the rest is up
        to you!
      </p>
      <p>
        please let me know which sections you find useful or not so useful, as
        well as any improvements you think are necessary and I shall do my best
        to impliment them!
